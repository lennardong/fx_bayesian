A **Jane Street quant** would likely prefer a more straightforward, parsimonious method that directly reflects the problem's structure without introducing excessive layers of uncertainty. They would avoid over-complicating the model with unnecessary assumptions and focus on capturing the expert opinion clearly and efficiently.

### A Simpler, More Evident Approach:

#### **Key Insights**:
1. You want to capture expert opinions as data generation points.
2. These opinions are **not absolute bounds**, but rather expressions of spread (likely in terms of 2 standard deviations).
3. Confidence should affect the spread directly without adding extraneous complexity.

### **Approach: Weighted Resampling and Simple Triangular Distribution**

Given this, a quant might **use a combination of resampling techniques** (to create variability in synthetic data) and a simple triangular distribution to directly reflect the asymmetry between `expected_highest_fx`, `expected_fx`, and `expected_lowest_fx`.

The **triangular distribution** naturally captures the skew, and confidence can control how tightly the samples concentrate around `expected_fx`.

### **Steps**:

1. **Use the triangular distribution** as the direct representation of expert opinion:
   - **Min**: `expected_lowest_fx`
   - **Max**: `expected_highest_fx`
   - **Mode**: `expected_fx` (the expert's most likely estimate)

2. **Confidence Scaling**: Confidence is directly used to scale the standard deviation of the distribution. Higher confidence narrows the variance around `expected_fx`.

3. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Use the triangular distribution to generate synthetic FX values. If confidence is low, allow a broader spread of data; if confidence is high, concentrate more tightly around the `expected_fx`.

4. **Fit the Beta Distribution**: Scale the synthetic data and fit a beta distribution using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), as the final step.

This approach stays **close to the expert data** without introducing multiple layers of estimation.

### Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data Using Triangular Distribution
def generate_synthetic_data_triangular(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence, size=1000):
    # Adjust spread based on confidence: higher confidence = tighter spread
    adjustment_factor = (1 - confidence) * 0.5  # Tweak for the degree of spread adjustment
    min_val = expected_lowest_fx - adjustment_factor * (expected_fx - expected_lowest_fx)
    max_val = expected_highest_fx + adjustment_factor * (expected_highest_fx - expected_fx)
    
    # Generate synthetic data using a triangular distribution
    synthetic_data = np.random.triangular(min_val, expected_fx, max_val, size)
    return synthetic_data

# Step 2: Fit Beta Distribution to the Data
def fit_beta_distribution(synthetic_data):
    # Scale data to range [0, 1] using min-max scaling
    scaled_data = (synthetic_data - synthetic_data.min()) / (synthetic_data.max() - synthetic_data.min())
    
    # Method of moments to estimate alpha and beta
    def beta_mle(params):
        alpha, beta = params
        if alpha <= 0 or beta <= 0:
            return np.inf  # Return large value to avoid invalid alpha/beta
        return -np.sum(stats.beta.logpdf(scaled_data, alpha, beta))
    
    # Initial guess for alpha and beta
    initial_guess = [1, 1]
    
    # Minimize the negative log-likelihood
    result = minimize(beta_mle, initial_guess, method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=[(0.01, None), (0.01, None)])
    
    alpha, beta = result.x
    return alpha, beta

# Example Usage:
expected_fx = 1.2
expected_highest_fx = 1.5
expected_lowest_fx = 1.0
confidence = 0.7

# Generate synthetic data
synthetic_data = generate_synthetic_data_triangular(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence)

# Fit beta distribution
alpha, beta = fit_beta_distribution(synthetic_data)

print(f"Estimated Alpha: {alpha}, Estimated Beta: {beta}")
```

### **Why This Approach?**

1. **Triangular Distribution**: 
   - The triangular distribution is very intuitive and minimal. It directly uses the three key expert opinion points: lowest, highest, and expected values. This makes it a good choice for reflecting skewed data in a simple way.
   
2. **Confidence Scaling**: 
   - Confidence controls the spread of the distribution, but without introducing an extra layer of randomness. If confidence is low, the triangular distribution’s spread widens; if confidence is high, it tightens.

3. **Directness**: 
   - There’s only one layer of uncertainty, and it’s directly tied to the expert’s opinion. This avoids adding uncertainty on top of uncertainty (like in the Gamma approach).
   
4. **Control Over Spread**:
   - Instead of fitting a separate distribution, we allow the expert’s own opinion to dictate the shape of the data. This reflects a key quant mindset—use the simplest tool that captures the essence of the problem.

### Summary:

- **Simplicity and Clarity**: Use a **triangular distribution** that directly encodes the asymmetry in expert opinions.
- **Confidence directly affects spread** without adding a second-order layer of uncertainty.
- **Quantitative Clarity**: Each parameter (highest, lowest, expected FX) has a clear, understandable impact on the synthetic data generation.

**Q1**: How would this approach change if you had multiple expert opinions with different levels of confidence?

**Q2**: What could be the potential downside of using the triangular distribution for more complex data?

**Q3**: How could this approach be extended to deal with time-series data or dynamically changing expert opinions?

**Q4**: What would the implications be of treating the confidence parameter as stochastic rather than deterministic?

**Q5**: How would this approach generalize to other domains where asymmetry in expert opinion matters?

To introduce **smoothness** and a **peak with falloff** in a way that still reflects the simplicity and intuition of the triangular distribution, you can transition to a **smoothed triangular distribution** or **kernel-based methods** that create a bias towards the peak (`expected_fx`) while tapering off smoothly toward the bounds (`expected_highest_fx` and `expected_lowest_fx`).

### Two Key Methods to Introduce Smoothness:
1. **Smoothed Triangular Distribution**: Use a custom probability density function (PDF) based on a Gaussian falloff around `expected_fx`, combined with a tapering towards the edges (`expected_highest_fx` and `expected_lowest_fx`). This adds a peak with a gradual decay, providing smoothness.

2. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: This method adds smoothness to any distribution by fitting a kernel around each generated point. This approach provides more flexibility while keeping the triangular shape as a base. A bias toward the peak can be introduced by generating more points around `expected_fx`.

### **Method 1: Smoothed Triangular Distribution**

You can create a hybrid between a **triangular** distribution and a **Gaussian falloff** to introduce smoothness. The idea is to retain the triangular bounds but apply a Gaussian-like bell curve around the peak.

#### Key Steps:
- Keep the triangular base (defined by `expected_lowest_fx`, `expected_fx`, and `expected_highest_fx`).
- Apply a **Gaussian-like decay** centered on `expected_fx` to smooth the edges.

#### Example Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

# Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data Using Smoothed Triangular Distribution
def smoothed_triangular_distribution(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence, size=1000):
    # Create triangular bounds
    min_val = expected_lowest_fx
    max_val = expected_highest_fx
    
    # Create linear falloff using triangular distribution properties
    base_data = np.random.triangular(min_val, expected_fx, max_val, size)
    
    # Apply a Gaussian smoothing function to introduce a peak with smooth falloff
    # Tweak the standard deviation based on confidence for smoothness control
    std_dev = (max_val - min_val) * (1 - confidence) * 0.5  # Adjust smoothness with confidence
    gaussian_smoothing = norm.pdf(base_data, loc=expected_fx, scale=std_dev)
    
    # Weight the base triangular data by the Gaussian smoothing
    weighted_data = base_data + gaussian_smoothing * (confidence * 0.5)
    
    return weighted_data

# Example Usage:
expected_fx = 1.2
expected_highest_fx = 1.5
expected_lowest_fx = 1.0
confidence = 0.7

# Generate smoothed synthetic data
smoothed_data = smoothed_triangular_distribution(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence)

# Plot the results to visualize the smoothing effect
plt.hist(smoothed_data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='g')
plt.title("Smoothed Triangular Distribution with Peak and Falloff")
plt.show()
```

### **Method 2: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**

This method adds flexibility by smoothing any distribution. We can generate synthetic data from a triangular distribution and then apply KDE to introduce smoothness and a peak at the desired location.

#### Key Steps:
- Generate synthetic data using a triangular distribution.
- Apply **Kernel Density Estimation** to smooth the data.
- KDE can emphasize the peak near `expected_fx`, allowing you to control the shape while keeping the bounds intact.

#### Example Code:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KernelDensity
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data Using Triangular Distribution
def generate_synthetic_data_triangular(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence, size=1000):
    adjustment_factor = (1 - confidence) * 0.5  # Adjust spread based on confidence
    min_val = expected_lowest_fx - adjustment_factor * (expected_fx - expected_lowest_fx)
    max_val = expected_highest_fx + adjustment_factor * (expected_highest_fx - expected_fx)
    
    # Generate data using a triangular distribution
    synthetic_data = np.random.triangular(min_val, expected_fx, max_val, size)
    return synthetic_data

# Step 2: Apply KDE Smoothing
def kde_smooth_data(data, bandwidth=0.02):
    kde = KernelDensity(kernel='gaussian', bandwidth=bandwidth).fit(data[:, None])
    log_dens = kde.score_samples(data[:, None])
    return np.exp(log_dens)

# Example Usage:
expected_fx = 1.2
expected_highest_fx = 1.5
expected_lowest_fx = 1.0
confidence = 0.7

# Generate synthetic data
synthetic_data = generate_synthetic_data_triangular(expected_fx, expected_highest_fx, expected_lowest_fx, confidence)

# Apply KDE to smooth the data
smoothed_density = kde_smooth_data(synthetic_data)

# Plot the results
plt.hist(synthetic_data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.5, label='Original Data')
plt.plot(np.sort(synthetic_data), smoothed_density[np.argsort(synthetic_data)], label='Smoothed Data', color='r')
plt.legend()
plt.title("KDE Smoothed Triangular Distribution")
plt.show()
```

### **Why These Methods?**
1. **Smoothed Triangular Distribution**: Retains the simplicity of the triangular distribution but introduces a smooth, bell-like falloff around the peak, adding nuance.
2. **KDE**: More general, flexible smoothing, allowing you to fine-tune the shape without straying from the core structure of the triangular base.

### **Choosing Between Them**:
- If you want a **controlled, direct smoothing** with adjustable sharpness, go for **smoothed triangular distribution**.
- If you need **greater flexibility** and dynamic smoothing (e.g., adaptive peak shapes), **KDE** is more appropriate.
